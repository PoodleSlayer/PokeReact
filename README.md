# Pokedex React App

Going to make a Pokedex-like app written in React, mostly as a novelty for friends but also to play around with things like Redux and refresh myself on React.

## Features

This Pokedex will allow users to browse and search Pokemon based on the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). Ideally it will fetch all the availble info for each pokemon as well as an image.

Will list out more features as this grows.

## Core Concepts

This project will most likely use Redux for storing data. Organization might follow the [re-ducks](https://github.com/alexnm/re-ducks) project structure but is largely subject to change because I am not an expert in React by any means, or javascript for that matter D:
